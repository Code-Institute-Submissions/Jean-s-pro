# Welcome to Jean's Online Professional Profile - simplified as <strong>Jean's pro</strong>

## Description
<p>
This websites serves for Jean Damascene Twizeyimana's online profile to show case of both his professional and social values. It is also a single source of information on the about Jean's professional journey so far. 
</p>
<p>The website was designed and developed with user experience in mind.<br>
I have followed the five planes of UX as a guiding framework.<br> Departed from researching data about how to design and develop professional profiles websites and resume in general and in the online space; I have come up with the MUST-HAVE elements of my professional website and the BETTER_TO_HAVE aspects of my professional online profile<br>
I have design 3 different wireframes and by testing each with its fit to exemplify UX, they yielded into the current end-product here presented.</p>
<p>
  The end product here presented is made of the six sections or pages: the index.html, contact us section that is embedded in the index, about us section that is also embedded in the index, competences, projects, working with me, and the read me file. 
</p>

<p>
  Each Page of the website is divided into three main blocks: header, content seztion, and the footer section. <br>
  The header element is divided into two main sub-sections: a section for log and main menu; and a section for utility menus.
  the content section contains the content for the section or page concerned. And the footer section for privacy declaration, owner info., and bottom menus.
